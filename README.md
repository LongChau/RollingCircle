# RollingCircle
An endless running game

Hi,
I want to make it funny rolling game. So I add some image and sound effect for it. Make the game more interest.
I also make an extra "highscore". To save user's highest score for future usage. 

The server I use for this game is GameSparks. You can find more details about in here: https://gamesparks.com/
GameSparks's server is not run in live-stage because I'm not contact to GameSparks yet, and the server is still in preview build.
However it contains full feature.
