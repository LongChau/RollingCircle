# Software Engineer Code Challenge Goals:

A good coding challenge should:

* Resemble work the candidate might do
* Have a clear and consistant grading criteria
* Require less than 4 hours to complete

## Resemble work the candidate might do

Things that a Senior software engineer should be expected to do:

* design an API
* architect a feature
* naming of things
* testing new work
* adding tests to existing work
* fixing bugs
* writing secure, scalable software
* writing code for the reader
* reducing logarithmic complexity
* choose the right tool for the job

## Have a clear and consistant grading criteria

A clear rubric will allow better comparison between candidates, and set each candidate up for success.

Here are the grading criteria:

* compiles
* functionally complete and correct
* secure
* adequate test coverage
* documented (README, doc style comments, other comments)
* managed dependencies
* easily deployed
* consistent, idiomatic coding style
* follows best practices of the language in question

## Require not more than 4 hours to complete

* A candidate's time is valuable, and reviewing a large code-base is also time consuming.
* Keeping a tight time-box on candidate take-home projects shows that we respect the candidate
* A short time window should cause a developer to pick certain things to do right, and others to do fast. In turn this provides a conversation point later on how they compromise.
